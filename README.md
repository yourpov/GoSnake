# GoSnake

Terminal snake game built with Go, Bubbletea and Lipgloss.

## Requirements

- go 1.21+

## Running it

```bash
go run .
```

or build it first:

```bash
go build -o gosnake.exe
.\gosnake.exe
```

## Controls

- WASD, Arrow keys, or Vim keys (hjkl) to move
- Space to pause
- Q to quit
- R to restart after game over

## How it works

The snake moves around a 30x20 grid eating food to grow longer. Game speeds up every 50 points. Don't hit the walls or yourself.

## Structure

```
main.go           entry point
core/
  game.go         bubbletea model and game loop
  snake.go        snake movement and collision
  food.go         food spawning
  board.go        rendering
  point.go        coordinate helpers
```

Game ticks every 150ms initially, getting faster as you score. Direction changes are buffered to prevent reversing into yourself between ticks.
